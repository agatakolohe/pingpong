#### Looping Practice with C# for Epicodus, 12-07-2020

#### By Agata Kolodziej, Patric Osten, Taylor Delph

## Description
Ping-pong is a classic programming exercise that utilizes branching and looping. Here's how it works:
A user enters a number and the application returns all numbers from 1 to the user input with the following changes:
All numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "ping".
All numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "pong".
All numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced by "ping-pong".
If the user enters 15, the program will return: 1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong", "ping", 7, 8, "ping", "pong", 11, "ping", 13, 14, "ping-pong"
